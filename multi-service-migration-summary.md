# Multi-Service Migration Summary

## Overview
We've successfully migrated the booking system from a single-service appointment model to a multi-service model, allowing customers to select multiple services during the booking process.

## Completed Changes

### Frontend UI Components
1. **ServiceSelector Component**
   - Created a new component to select multiple services
   - Added grid layout with selection cards for services
   - Implemented toggle selection and visual feedback

2. **ServicesList Component**
   - Created a reusable component to display multiple services
   - Supports compact mode with badges for space-efficient display
   - Handles price and duration displays
   - Calculates and shows total price

3. **BookingConfirmation Updates**
   - Modified to handle multiple services
   - Shows itemized list of services with individual prices
   - Displays total price of all selected services
   - Sends array of service IDs to the API

4. **BookingTimeSlots Updates**
   - Enhanced to calculate availability based on total service duration
   - Prevents booking when services would extend beyond working hours
   - Shows total duration to the user
   - Checks for overlapping appointments

5. **BookingHistoryList Updates**
   - Redesigned to show multiple services per appointment
   - Utilizes the ServicesList component for consistent UI

### State Management
1. **Booking Flow**
   - Added service selection step to the booking flow
   - Implemented state management for multiple selected services
   - Added validation for service selection

2. **Data Calculations**
   - Added calculations for total price of multiple services
   - Added calculations for total duration of multiple services
   - Implemented slot availability based on total duration

### API Integration
1. **API Function Updates**
   - Updated `bookProfessionalService` to handle multiple services
   - Changed API endpoint path for multi-service bookings
   - Updated `createAppointment` to send array of service IDs

2. **Data Fetching**
   - Added `fetchProfessionalServices` for service selection

## Key Files Modified
- `src/pages/Booking.tsx`: Main booking flow
- `src/components/booking/BookingConfirmation.tsx`: Appointment confirmation
- `src/components/booking/BookingTimeSlots.tsx`: Time slot selection
- `src/components/booking/ServiceSelector.tsx`: Service selection UI
- `src/components/booking/ServicesList.tsx`: Displaying multiple services
- `src/components/booking/BookingHistoryList.tsx`: Appointment history display
- `src/lib/api.ts`: API integration functions

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various combinations of services (single, multiple, long duration)
2. Verify time slot availability calculations with different service durations
3. Confirm proper display of multiple services in booking confirmation and history
4. Test edge cases: services that span entire working day, overlapping appointments

## Future Considerations
1. Consider adding a maximum limit for services per appointment
2. Implement grouping of similar services
3. Add recommended service combinations
4. Implement discounts for service bundles
