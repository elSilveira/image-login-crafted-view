# Multi-Service Migration Log

## Overview
This log tracks the implementation progress of migrating from single-service to multi-service appointments.

## Requirements
- Update UI/UX to allow selection of multiple services
- Modify appointment creation logic to handle an array of service IDs
- Update appointment display to show multiple services
- Update availability calculation based on total duration of selected services
- Handle validation, error messages, and state management for multiple services

## Implementation Plan
1. Update `Booking.tsx` to:
   - Store an array of selected services instead of a single service
   - Add UI for selecting multiple services
   - Calculate total duration and price of selected services

2. Update `BookingConfirmation.tsx` to:
   - Display all selected services
   - Calculate and show total price and duration
   - Send serviceIds array in the appointment creation payload

3. Update `api.ts` to handle the new appointment payload format

4. Test all booking flows with multiple services

## Implementation Progress

### 2023-06-15: Initial Analysis
- Analyzed current implementation in Booking.tsx, BookingConfirmation.tsx, and api.ts
- Studied the new API contract for multi-service appointments
- Created migration plan

### 2023-06-16: Implementation of Multi-Service Selection
- Created a new `ServiceSelector` component for selecting multiple services
- Added `fetchProfessionalServices` endpoint to API
- Updated `Booking.tsx` to support multiple service selection:
  - Added a new service selection step in the booking flow
  - Implemented state management for multiple selected services
  - Added calculation of total price and duration
- Updated `BookingConfirmation.tsx` to:
  - Accept an array of services instead of a single service
  - Display all selected services with their individual prices
  - Calculate and show total price and duration
  - Send an array of `serviceIds` in the API payload

### 2023-06-17: Enhanced Time Slot Calculation for Multiple Services
- Updated `BookingTimeSlots` component to:
  - Calculate availability based on the total duration of all selected services
  - Check for overlapping appointments and block unavailable slots
  - Show the total duration of all selected services to the user
  - Prevent booking if the service would extend beyond the professional's working hours
- Modified `Booking.tsx` to pass the selected services array to `BookingTimeSlots`

### 2023-06-18: Implemented Multi-Service UI Components
- Created a reusable `ServicesList` component for displaying multiple services:
  - Supports compact mode for badges-style display
  - Shows prices and durations when needed
  - Calculates and displays total price
  - Handles scrolling for long lists
- Updated `BookingHistoryList` to use the new `ServicesList` component:
  - Restructured mock data to include arrays of services
  - Updated UI to display multiple services per appointment
  - Shows total price for all services in an appointment

### 2023-06-19: Updated API Integration
- Refactored API functions to support multi-service model:
  - Updated `bookProfessionalService` to accept an array of `serviceIds` in the payload
  - Changed API endpoint path to `/professionals/{professionalId}/book`
  - Updated `createAppointment` function to handle the new appointment payload format
- Completed the full-circle implementation of multi-service appointments:
  - Selection: User can select multiple services
  - Calculation: Total price and duration are calculated based on all selected services 
  - Availability: Time slots are filtered based on total service duration
  - Confirmation: All services are displayed with total price
  - API: Multiple service IDs are sent to the backend

### Next Steps
- Test the multi-service booking flow with various combinations of services
- Add validation to ensure all selected services are available with the chosen professional
- Review edge cases for time slot calculation with multiple services
- Consider adding maximum number of services limit if needed
- Update unit and integration tests to reflect multi-service functionality
